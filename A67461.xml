            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have great reaſon to be heartily ſorry, not onely for my ſelf and many others here, but alſo for the concern of ſeveral Gentlemen who have an intereſt and correſpondence here, though they inhabit other places; That I muſt give you the ſad relation of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateſt accident, and of the greateſt damage that ever happened in theſe parts by inundation of Waters. For it pleaſed God that on laſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday Night a moſt furious North-Weſt wind did blow ſo hard as to force the Sea, with the Spring Tides over, and break down our Banks, Dikes, and Sluces into the Country; inſomuch that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly North-Holland, which we hear is all overflow'd and quite drownd, but alſo Haerlem Muyden, and this City have received the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt loſſes that they ever yet ſuſtained; for the Haerlemmer-Meer breaking in upon us filled moſt of our ſtreets and Burgh-walls, with

               </gap>rs, Ware-houſes, and our lower-Rooms are all under water, nay, even to the Statt-Houſe it ſelf, whereby not onely the goods and Merchandizes therein are ſpoiled, and ſo much indamag'd that no credible computation can as yet be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven what exceeding detriment this City alone hath thereby ſuſtained; many millions already beſides the irrepairable loſs of many hundreds of Men, Women, and Children, who have periſhed already in this ſecond deluge.</p>
            <p>And the Almighty God alone knoweth when we ſhall ſee end of our Miſeries; for the Waters as yet rather increaſe then abate; I my ſelf am forced to remove out of my Houſe for my own and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ſecurities, and yet know not well where to go to be free from danger, having already ſuffered damage for my own friends and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents accounts to the value of 200000 Guilders in my Sellars and Ware-houſes that I know of; and what is not yet come to my knowledge; and what may happen no Man can imagine, but God's will be done; It is a ſad thing to be confined to live in a Country ſcituated ſo low, that a Man muſt be beholding to the Trench of the banks, for the ſecurity of his life and fortune; for if at any time the great Dike between <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> give way, (as it has many times done within theſe few years) the whole Country again becomes that Sea which once it was; nor are we expoſed onely to accident, but even to the malice of our enemies, and (which has been as fatal to us as any thing) our own convenience, of which this laſt war has given ſevere Teſtimonies, wherein you know the inhabitants of theſe parts have been almoſt as ſevere to themſelves for their preſervation; and this very inundation which looks ſo like deſtruction; but I believe 'twill be no advantage to you, and I am ſure it is no way pleaſant to me to enlarge my ſelf upon our misfortunes; I shall only add that amidſt them all, I am</p>
